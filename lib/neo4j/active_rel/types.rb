      # WRAPPED_CLASSES maps relationship types to ActiveRel models.
      #
      # Typically, it's a 1:1 relationship, with a type having a model of the same name. Sometimes, someone needs to be a precious
      # snowflake and have a model name that doesn't match the rel type, so this comes in handy.
      #
      # As an example, Chris often finds it easier to name models after the classes that use the relationship: `StudentLesson` instead of
      # `EnrolledIn`, because it's easier to remember "A student has a relationship to lesson" than "the type of relationship between Student
      # and Lesson is 'EnrolledIn'." After all, that is a big part of why we have models, right? To make our lives easier?
      #
      # A model is added to WRAPPED_CLASSES when it is initalized AND when the `type` class method is called within a model. This means that
      # it's possible a model will be added twice: once with the rel_type version of the model name, again with the custom type. deal_with_it.gif.
      #
      # As an alternative to this, you can call the `set_classname` class method to insert a `_classname` property into your relationship,
      # which will completely bypass this whole process.
