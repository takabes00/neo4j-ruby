  # -A User can have many Tours and Bands
  # -A Tour can have many Routes and Bands
  # -A Route must have exactly one Tour
  # -A Route can have many Stops
  # -A Stop can be part of many Routes and must have at least one
  # -A Band can be a part of many tours but must have at least one User
  # -Everything can be commented on. When an object is destroyed, all comments can be deleted in the database.
